                <h2>Control</h2>
                <p>Control is a game mode in which two teams fight over a capture point in a best-of-three format. While
                    a team has control over a capture point, that team will gain capture percentage until they reach
                    100%, and the team that reaches 100% first wins the round. Overtime will be triggered if one team
                    has reached 99% and the point is currently being contested. This game mode does not have a time
                    limit, unlike others.

                <h2>Escort</h2>
                <p>Escort is a game mode in which the attacking team must escort a payload to a delivery point, while
                    the defending team attempts to prevent them until the timer runs out. Each map has three checkpoints
                    between the starting position and delivery point which, when reached, will increase the timer and
                    move both teams' spawn locations. Overtime will be triggered if time runs out while the payload is
                    being contested by the attacking team. <!-- Escort is my favorite gamemode -->

                <h2>Push</h2>
                <p>Push is a game mode released alongside Overwatch 2. Two teams fight to escort a robot who pushes an
                    objective onto the opposite (enemy) side of the map. Each map has two checkpoints along the
                    objective path. When a team escorts the robot past the first enemy checkpoint, their spawn is moved
                    up to "forward spawn." If neither team reaches both checkpoints, the team that pushed their
                    objective the furthest wins. Overtime will trigger if the team with less progress has possession of
                    the robot when time expires.

                <h2>Flashpoint</h2>
                <p>Flashpoint is a game mode released in Season 6, and bears some similarities to Control. Each
                    Flashpoint map has five capture points, called "flashpoints," and a team must capture three to win
                    the game. Flashpoints' capture speed is much faster than a Control capture point. Once a team
                    captures a point, the next point will unlock after 40 seconds.
