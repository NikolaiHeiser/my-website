    <h1>Roles</h1>
    <article>
        <h5>Tank</h5>
        <p class="roles"> Tank heroes soak up damage, create space for your team, and break apart fortified positions, like
            closely-grouped enemies and narrow choke-points. If you are a tank, you lead the charge. There are currently
            12 playable tank heroes.</p>

        <h1>Damage</h1>
        <p class ="roles"> Damage heroes are responsible for seeking out, engaging, and defeating the enemy using their varied tools and
            abilities. Playing a damage hero means it is your duty to secure kills. There are currently 18 playable
            damage heroes.</p>

        <h1>Support</h1>
        <p class="roles"> Support heroes empower their allies by healing them, boosting their damage, and providing vital utility. As
            support, you’re the backbone of your team’s survival. There are currently 10 playable support heroes, with
            another coming out in the near future.</p>
