"Make sure all of your pages link to each other with href attributes. I was able to go to your Roles page from Home but not Home from Roles."

I fixed this by making sure the href attributes to link the pages were present on all 4 pages.

"2. Don't forget to add footers on your website"

Made sure to add the footer code to all 4 pages.
